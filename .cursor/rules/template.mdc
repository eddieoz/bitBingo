 # Template Rule

This rule defines how to transform high-level tasks into detailed step-by-step instructions for AI coding agents.

## Rule Structure

1. **Codebase Reference**
   - Use the provided codebase as reference
   - Include relevant code snippets when necessary
   - Be specific about file names and locations

2. **Task Transformation**
   - Convert high-level tasks into detailed step-by-step instructions
   - Instructions should be specific and actionable
   - Focus only on steps that an AI coding agent can complete
   - Include all necessary file paths and code references

3. **Build Process**
   - Always include a build step at the end
   - Specify exact build command to run
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly referenced

4. **Formatting**
   - Use markdown formatting throughout
   - Keep instructions clear and concise
   - Use code blocks for code snippets
   - Include file paths in backticks

## Example Usage

```markdown
1. Search for relevant files in the codebase
   - Use semantic search to find related code
   - Look in specific directories if needed

2. Analyze the existing code structure
   - Review file contents
   - Understand dependencies
   - Note any patterns or conventions

3. Create or modify files as needed
   - Follow project conventions
   - Include all necessary imports
   - Maintain consistent formatting
   - Don't change the actual code style or structure if not explicit asked

4. Run build process
   - Execute `pnpm build`
   - Fix any errors
   - Ignore warnings
```

## Important Notes

- Do not include testing steps
- Do not include manual verification steps
- Focus only on steps that can be automated
- Be specific about file locations and names
- Always include a build step at the end
- Try to fix things at the cause, not the symptom
- Be very detailed with summarization and do not miss out things that are important
